These are functions to help you manage your tags; namely to view and edit the relevant tags and entries.

=== Using templates to specify resume formats
Templates are stored as text files and parsed and loaded into the application using the `loadtemplate` command.

==== Loading template : `loadtemplate`

Loads a template from a text file into the application. +
Format: `loadtemplate FILEPATH`

Examples:

* `loadtemplate google.txt` +
Loads the template specified in `google.txt`

==== Writing template files
//TODO: how do we have parallel structure for this?
Templates are written by the user as text files, consisting of lines of the following format:
-----
[Category Heading]:[~Category Tag]:[Tag Groups]
-----

Each line specifies a category, starting with the title to be displayed, its corresponding category tag, and tags used to filter entries.

An entry is included if it is tagged with that category, and fulfils any of the groups of tags, separated by a space.
Each group contains tags separated by an ampersand (&),
and an entry must contain all tags in a group to fulfil the group.

For example, the following template file:
[literal]
--
Work Experience:~work:
Education:~education:uni training&cs
Projects:~projects:software&java&recent
--
Will result in the resume being generated as follows:
[sidebar]
--
*Work Experience* +
(all work entries regardless of tags)

*Education* +
(education entries tagged with `uni`, or both `training` and `cs`)

*Projects* +
(project entries tagged with `software`, `java` and `recent`)
--

=== Generating Resume : `make`

Generates a Resume file in Markdown format with the given name, using the _template_ currently loaded in the application.

Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Entry book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
